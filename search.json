      "content"  : "People ask how they can get started with reclaiming their personal privacy.  Often they’ll get discouraged because the amount of time and effort seems overwhelming.  This post discusses some things that can be done to get started, it isn’t meant to be a complete list or exhaustive, just some basics to be more private.  The key is to remember that the journey to having and maintaining privacy is a marathon, not a sprint.It is often said that you can’t have privacy without security, so I’ll start with a list of things that can be done to improve your digital security posture.SecurityUse a password managerIt is hard for people to remember passwords, so often they’ll use the same one for everything.  Whether that is a complex password or not, this is a very bad idea.  If your password to one service ever got exposed there are automated programs that will try that same username/email and password combination at several other services and compromise your account there as well if you have one.  Even if you think “I’m careful about who I give my password to”, it doesn’t matter.  Companies have breaches all the time, and passwords are often in the data.The best approach is to have a unique password for every service you use, and to have that password be something that is randomly generated, of decent length containing letters, numbers and symbols.  Because this will be impossible to remember you’ll need a trusted tool where you can store all your passwords, this is where a “password manager” comes in.  The idea is that you have one password to unlock the tool and then you can access all your passwords like a database.My favorite password manager is Bitwarden because first it is open source so everything it is doing with my sensitive information can be easily audited.  It is available for desktop, mobile and web with a seamless sync feature.  There are browser plugins available for easy insertion of credentials into login forms and it supports 2 factor authentication.  It also has a free version available that is quite feature rich, so getting started is a breeze.For people a little more paranoid that don’t want their password manager connected to the internet at all you could checkout KeePassXC which is also open source.I have previously also used 1Password which has a good reputation, and has passed many security audits.  It’s UI/UX may be the best of all the password manager tools, however I don’t tend to recommend to people because it is not open source.Delete old, unused accountsTake a look through your bookmarks, think back in your memory, maybe scan through your email and find accounts that you don’t use anymore.  Instead of just abandoning them, never to return.  Log in and find out how to delete your account permanently.  This task has become easier with the legal requirements of CCPA and GDPR making the ability for users to delete their data a requirement.The reason you want to delete your data is to remove yourself from the list of targets in a potential data breach with any of these services that you no longer use.User 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)Increase your digital security by using 2 factor authentication, sometimes called 2 step login anywhere and everywhere that supports it.  This means that when you login to a service with your username and password, the service will request an additional piece of information from you, usually generated on demand.  That way if someone did get access to your login credentials they’d need control of a second piece of authentication as well to get into your account.via Text MessageOften services will send you a text message with a code after you login.  To complete the login you’ll have to enter the code they just sent you.  Thus someone would need access to your mobile phone as well as having your login credentials to access your account.  Sometimes services send a code to your email instead.This method of 2FA is the minimum feature you should be looking for.  For most people it will work fine, however there are a few issues with text / email messages bing totally secure.via An App (TOTP)Most 2FA apps are paired with the service you are logging into by scanning a QR code.  The app will generate a code that changes every 30 seconds or so.  This kind of code is called a Time-based One Time Password or TOTP.  Because the service you are logging into and your code generation application are synced they both know what the code should be based on a random “seed” that was created when the two were originally synced.This is avery good form of 2FA because it requires that the person logging in has to have the TOTP code, usually generated on a mobile device in addition to the login credentials and the code changes frequently.One word of caution here, you’ll want to make sure you have a way to backup your TOTP application, specifically the “seeds” for each account you add.  If you lose your phone, or access to your TOTP application it can be very difficult if not impossible to get access to your account again.My favorite applications for TOTP on Android are andOTP  and Aegis because they are open source and feature rich.  On iOS I’d recommend Google Authenticator.  All these softwares have a “backup” feature, make sure you use it.TOTP is a very good option for security and the one that I use most often because it is pretty widely available on most services and provides very good security.via Hardware KeyLikely the most secure 2FA option is the use of a “hardware key”.  This generally takes the form of a usb-stick-like device which is manufactured to be completely unique and not able to be copied.  To generate your one time password that is used as your second form of authentication the device is connected to your computer or phone and activated (usually by touching it).  At that time algorithms on the device generate the one time code and send it to the service.These hardware devices are considered the most secure because they can’t be copied, but that also means you can’t back it up.  My recommendation is that if you have a service that allows you to add a hardware token, you should add more than one, or you should add a TOTP software option as a backup if possible.  That way if your hardware token is lost you have an alternative 2fa option.Yubikey is my recommendation as to which hardware token you should get.  They are quite widely used and have passed several security audits.PrivacyNow that you have made yourself a harder target, it is time to clean up what others can find out about you.Credit FreezeOne of the very first things you should do is freeze your credit profile with all the major credit reporting agencies.  This will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name as well as alert you to potentially nefarious changes to your existing accounts. The well known privacy author Michael Bazzell has a great credit freeze worksheet that is easy to follow for this project.Data RemovalThe next project is to try and get your information removed from as many online data brokers as possible.  There is an entire industry of companies that buy and sell data about people from various sources, much of which becomes free or partially redacted online.  Your goal is to become a ghost, to control your data so that any data that can be found about you is data that you put out.  Again author Michael Bazzell has a great data removal workbook that can be followed for this project.This process will take a while, just work on it a little at a time till you get done.  Remember, this is a marathon not a sprint.Ongoing OperationsAfter you’ve hardened your day to day access to various services you’ll want to make some changes to how you interact with the internet.  Note that this doesn’t have to come in any particular order, though I think switching to a password manager may be the most important thing to do first.Web BrowserWebsites are constantly tracking you online, how much information they take and what they do with it depends on the site.  It is hard to tell if they are using the information to improve the product or to sell to other 3rd parties.  Its a good practice to disable these tracking features, but understanding how can be a bit technical.  For most people just getting started in reclaiming their privacy a good option for a browser that “just works” is Brave.  Brave is open source and has a concept of “shields”.  This is the tracker blocking feature which does a decent job of disabling the tracking while still allowing websites to function properly.CommunicationsMost people don’t realize that telephone calls, SMS messages and emails are not private and secure.  There is a presumption of privacy because the conversation may be between you and another person you trust, but your service provider is in the middle.  Making things worse the contents of your communication travel across the wire in clear text, so any party involved in passing your message along can see its contents.As Surveillance Capitalism continues to take hold many service providers are quietly changing their privacy policies and terms of service that govern what they are allowed to do with your data.  Often this results in some kind of alternative revenue streams like outright selling the data or using it to sell ads.  Here is an example of a carrier injecting ads into a user’s text message based on the content the carrier observed.What is the solution?  Use end-to-end (E2E) encrypted communications.  Apps like Signal and Wire are open source and provide video, voice and text options.  The E2E encryption means that the contents of the communication can’t be seen by anyone except you and the party you are talking to.  Ideally the application you use will have no knowledge of who you are outside of a a random user id that isn’t personally tied to you in some way.PaymentsIf you didn’t know it already, your bank and the places you shop are tracking you and selling your data.  Banks will sell transaction information about the places you shop, how much you spend and when.  That information is then used by advertisers to try and sell you other products and services.  The places you shop are doing the same thing, whether they are trying to boost their own sales, make money through an affiliate or engage a service like refund fraud.  The bottom line is that information you thought was private is leaking out everywhere.What can you do?  The simplest option is to use cash for as many in person transactions as possible.  Cash is anonymous and accepted in most places, it is easy to get from your bank and leaves no transaction trail that can be tied to you by your bank or by vendors.For online shopping I like to use Privacy.com.  You can generate a one time use credit card number, or for online subscriptions create a number that is tied to that particular vendor.  You can set limits on the card to govern how much it can be charged and when.  This is great from a security perspective in that a disposable card number that gets caught up in a data breach is of no concern to you.  If your card is active for a subscription and compromised you just need to update one card, not every service you use.  This is a similar concept to using unique passwords.From a privacy perspective privacy.com cards allow you to obscure what your bank sees about the transaction.  For example if you bought socks online from awesomesocks.com on 01/05/2022 for $10.00,  you can configure your transaction log so that the bank sees a $10 charge on that date to “Smileys corner store”.  Even better, privacy.com will successfully pass address validation for any address you enter when using one of their card numbers.  This means you can create an disposable alias for your purchase, use a card number that will only be used once, and your bank won’t know where you spent that money.  Everyone in the chain that wants to sell your data now doesn’t have anything, at least not that can be used to link back to you.Some people will point out that Privacy.com holds all your data now, which is true.  That said, I’d rather my data be in the hands of a company that has a mission organized around privacy and is transparent about their policies, than leave it in the hands of others with a historically bad track record.ConclusionIf you are just getting started on your privacy journey I hope this introduction is a helpful starting point.  Remember, this is a marathon not a sprint.  This process will take some time ,but with each step I bet you’ll feel lighter and more free, more private and in control.  Feel free to drop me a line and discuss your experiences and any different tools &amp; techniques you implement."

      "content"  : "Paying with cash is a great way to preserve your privacy and anonymity when making purchases.  Provided you aren’t giving a frequent shopper number with your purchase, vendors who you buy from won’t be able to associate your transactions back to you.  This is a great way to avoid future advertising and profiling from the vendor, or others they are selling data to.To illustrate this point there is a pretty well known story where Target used transaction history to advertise related products to a teenage girl based on her past purchases.  The creepy part is that these products were in the maternity category.  The result was that Target knew that the girl was pregnant based on her purchases before her parents.Your bank is also selling your transaction data, usually to 3rd parties that are using it to find creative ways to advertise to you.  This varies from bank to bank but it is often something you can’t opt out of.Paying with cashPaying with cash is easy, it is accepted at most venues for in person transactions and it doesn’t have any of your metadata associated.  Sometimes people are concerned about walking around with a bunch of cash.  This can pretty easily be solved by keeping a reserve at home, based on where you are headed for the day you can supply as needed.  If you are concerned about the safety of your stash at home, there are plenty of incognito safe options like a “book safe”.Making withdrawsIf you are paying with cash you won’t want to walk around with a roll of $100 bills, not only from a security perspective but also many vendors won’t break large bills.  For this reason I always figure out how much money I want to withdraw and round that to the nearest amount that will get me the same quantity of each bill.For example, withdrawing $744 will let you get 4 of each bill from $1 - $100 (excluding the $2 bill which you can still get at most banks and will want to mention that you don’t want).            Denomination      Quantity      Total                  $100 bills      4      $400              $50 bills      4      $200              $20 bills      4      $80              $10 bills      4      $40              $5 bills      4      $20              $1 bills      4      $4              Grand Total             $744      You can adjust this as you see fit.  I have definitely let the teller know that I’d let them know the quantity of each bill I want then they are ready, and had a different quantity for each denomination, however being able to say “I’d like to have that in 4 of every bill except the $2” makes it very easy to convey what you are looking for.Exact changeYou will come across some circumstances where a vendor may only take cash if you provide exact change.  This became more common to see at otherwise cash friendly stores in the summer of 2020 when there was a “national coin shortage” in the US due to lack of labor since workers had ben sent home due to the pandemic.  Now how the US mint was not labeled an “essential” business is beyond me, some argue it was intentional, but I’ll leave my tin foil hat on the desk for now.  This situation called for exact change, which is quite easy to handle if you prepare for it.Below is a table that outlines the exact amount of cash and coin you need and each denomination to pay for anything between $0.01 and $100.  If you need more than $100 you can just add $100 bills to this distribution and you can pay for any amount you like.            Denomination      Quantity                  $50 bills      1              $20 bills      1              $10 bills      2              $5 bills      1              $1 bills      4              pennies      4              quarters      3              nickles      2              dimes      1      Things to look out forEveryone’s spending habits will vary, but if you find that the exact change table above only allows you to pay for one purchase in exact change just supplement each denomination as needed to carry more.Card only self checkoutI’ve noticed a few grocery stores and large hardware chains that will have self checkout lanes, but some of them are card payment only, and others are cash and card.  You just need to be conscious that this could be the case before you select the self checkout terminal you’ll visit.  I’ve yet to see where all the terminals are card only, but if they were you’d likely just need to wait for a live person to perform the checkout.Card only vendors &amp; prepaid gift cardsSometimes I’ve encountered a vendor who will only take cards and will not accept cash even if you give them exact change.  Mostly I’ve seen this with food trucks or walking vendors who don’t have anywhere to keep and track the cash.  For this situation I always keep a backup prepaid gift card on hand.When buying your prepaid gift card you want to look for one that is NOT reloadable, and is a “gift card”.  This generally means that there will not be any “know your customer” (kyc) requirements at the time of purchase.  You can usually get these gift cards from your local grocery or convenience store.  You’ll have to pay an activation fee (usually around $5) in addition to the amount you want to put on the card.  Pay for the gift card in cash so that any future purchases aren’t linked to you.  The ones I use are visa and simply say “gift card” and “debit visa”.  In a debit situation the last 4 digits of the card are usually the pin, however the instructions that come with the card will spell this out.  I’ve actually never had one of these cards evaluate as a debit card, only credit.You do not want to ever register these cards online as it will trigger some KYC data requirements like your social security number, so these cards are for in-person, card only payments.You also want to shred or otherwise destroy these cards once the balance is used up.  Using just the information on the card itself you can log into a website associated with the card and see all the past transaction history.ConclusionI hope my experiences outlined here help in your journey to enhance your privacy by using private payment methods.  Feel free to drop me a line and discuss your experiences and any different tools &amp; techniques you implement."

      "tags"     : "how-to, tools, and mobile",
      "url"      : "/software/roll-your-own-push-notification-services-for-grapheneos",
      "date"     : "2022-01-05 05:16:14 -0500",
      "content"  : "The ProblemGrapheneOS is an awesome, open source and secure mobile operating system. I’ve ran it for a year or so and had a mostly positive experience.  The one thing that can get in the way is the lack of push notifications.  Now this doesn’t mean that you can’t get “notifications” at all from events triggered off the phone.  Signal, Wire, Linphone etc. all run in the background and maintain their own server socket connections for push style notifications.  GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation of Google services like microG.  GrapheneOS HomepageThe hang up comes when you have installed an application from the Aurora store for example, and it was built to run with Google Play services, relying on that system for notifications.  Since GrapheneOS doesn’t support Google Play Services in any form, including alternative / anonymous implementations like MicroG (a free software clone of Google’s proprietary core libraries and applications), those notification features just silently fail.If you are ok with “The Pull Life” where you don’t get notifications and instead you go check to see what has happened while you were away, then you have no problem at all.  Honestly that makes for better sanity, but for some things you need to use a particular app, and you need notifications.The Solution (kind of)So I say this is “kind of” a solution because it is definitely a hack and doesn’t work universally. If you really need to run apps like normal with push notifications and all, and you still want a privacy oriented mobile OS you should probably checkout CalyxOS instead as they do support MicroG and most apps that do use Google Play Services just work like normal.  This is what I ended up migrating to and am happy with the result.The solution I came up with was running my own Gotify server and installing their android client app to receive the notifications on Graphene, both are open source.  The Gotify server is written in GoLang and is built for sending and receiving messages, it has a REST API and you can send messages through it quite easily using curl.I say this is a hack, because you have to intercept the notification from the source somehow and then make a HTTP request (curl etc.) to the Gotify server which will then send the notification to your phone.  So first that means more work, separate integration for each thing you want to get a notification about, if it can even be done.  So it isn’t an all in solution, but it does work for some things.Installation &amp; ConfigurationGetting a Gotify server up and running is super easy if you have Docker installed. The Gotify server documentation gives a few one line commands for booting the docker image, and a sample docker-compose file if you prefer that option.Most all the configuration values can be overridden using environment variables so docker-compose works great.  This is the configuration I used for my docker-compose.yml file, which can be executed in the same directory with docker-compose up.version: "3"services:  gotify:    image: gotify/server    ports:      - 8080:80    volumes:      - "./gotify_data:/app/data"    restart: unless-stopped    environment:      - GOTIFY_SERVER_PORT: 1234      - GOTIFY_SERVER_SSL_PORT: 2234      - GOTIFY_DEFAULTUSER_NAME: admin      - GOTIFY_DEFAULTUSER_PASS: passSetup GotifyAfter you have the Gotify Server running and you’ve logged in, you have to create a client and an application.  Gotify expects that applications will be creating messages, and clients will be consuming them, users also consume the messages.  The applications, clients and messages all belong to the user that created them and the server is multi-tenant in that one user can’t access the other’s records.  Only the admin user has the ability to create other users.If you had multiple things you were trying to integrate, you’d want to create an application for each.  Each application has a name and can have its own icon.  I used this for SMS messages that came in via Twilio, Slack messages Security camera notifications.Once you have an application configured you’ll want to note the token that automatically gets generated.  That will be used in the HTTP request to create a message on behalf of that application.  It is how the application authenticates to the server.You can test this out by issuing a curl command in your terminal.  In this example my Gotify server is running via docker and available on port 80 which is the standard http port for an unsecured URL (http://).curl "http://localhost/message?token=Aqo4dc8B5pSTnke" -F "title=My Message" -F "message=this is the body of my message" -F "priority=8"You’ll want to checkout the documentation on messages, there are some interesting things you can do.  For example only notify me on mobile if the priority of a message is 8 or above.  Or provide a URL such that if I click on the message in my client, it will go to that URL.ScreenshotsServer Web Application                    Android Client            As I mentioned earlier I did end up migrating away from GrapheneOS to CalyxOS and push notification support was one of the biggest reasons.  That said I’m also happy I had the experience with Gotify and have implemented it into some other projects already.  If you are a software developer you could also integrate a Gotify based notification structure directly into your android mobile application for a seamless experience similar to how Signal and Wire have their own built in notification sub systems.Hopefully my experiences with this project help you with GrapheneOS and or notifications in general.  Feel free to drop me a line and discuss your experiences or other apps &amp; techniques you use."

      "content"  : "Audible audiobooks include DRM which means that natively you can only play them via audible’s web player, their own applications or other applications that integrate with Audible to interpret that DRM.  They do allow you to download the audiobook file, however most open source players don’t support Audible’s DRM.  To enable applications like Voice to play the audiobook, chapters and all, you need to strip out the DRM.Anti-Piracy NoticeNote that this process does not 'crack' the DRM. It simply allows a user to use their own encryption key (fetched from Audible servers) to decrypt the audiobook in the same manner that the official audiobook playing software does.  This assumes that you are using your own audible account, decrypting your own audiobooks that you paid for and not distributing the decrypted version.Please only use this process and referenced applications for gaining full access to your own audiobooks for archiving/conversion/convenience. DeDRMed audiobooks should not be uploaded to open servers, torrents, or other methods of mass distribution. No help will be given to people doing such things. Authors, retailers, and publishers all need to make a living, so that they can continue to produce audiobooks for us to hear, and enjoy. Don't be a parasite.This message is borrowed from the https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com  page.SetupBefore you get started a couple bits of software are needed.  First you’ll want to install chromium-chromedriver and ffmepg.  I’ll assume that you already have GIT, Python 3 and Python PIP installed, if not there are plenty of tutorials online to get that setup.  Install commands below are for Linux, however if you are running OSX or Windows you can search how to install these pieces of software on those systems.sudo apt install chromedriver ffmpegpip3 install selenium requestsgit clone https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activatorcd audible-activatorsed -i '' 's,chromedriver_path = "./chromedriver",chromedriver_path = "/usr/bin/chromedriver",' audible-activator.pyNote, that you may need to change the chromedriver_path depending on where yours got installed.  Now you are ready to run the audible-activator script which will prompt you for your audible.com username and password, then print out an 8 character “activation key”.Get your encryption keypython3 audible-activator.pyThe sed command above is necessary to set the location of the chromedriver binary.  You may see an error if you omit this command even if chromedriver is in your path, or even in the same directory.  If your installation of sed is the GNU version, remove the two single quotes after -i in the beginning of the command.If all has gone correctly running the audible-activator.py script should prompt you for your audible username and password, there may be a prompt about needing to enter a one time password, but if you follow the directions you should end with output as seen below, note down the activation_bytes value given:activation_bytes: a1234a12Convert your audiobookIf you haven’t already done so, log into the audible.com web interface, find the audio book you want and select the option to download.  This may result in an MP4 or sometimes an AAX file.I find that for my purposes the most simple avenue is to just convert the audiobook into an audio file, it will still have chapters, but no cover art, more on that in a minute.To remove the DRM we’re going to use ffmpeg and our encryption / activation key.  For a file downloaded from audible.com as book.mp4 you’d use the following command:ffmpeg -y -activation_bytes a1234a12 -i book.mp4 -c:a copy -vn book.m4aNow you are ready to go, just transfer the resulting M4A file to your player and enjoy.Cover art (optional)If you want to have cover art, there IS a way to do it, which is to create a video file, that uses the audio track, and just loops the cover art over and over.  I don’t love this approach and don’t use it myself for several reasons.  It creates a larger file and player softwares treat video differently than audio with different controls.  On a video file I didn’t have great luck using an open source audiobook player like Voice and instead had to use VLC.If you do want to go this route, first you’ll need to extract the cover image as a PNG from the file you downloaded from audible.com (book.mp4 in our example).ffmpeg -y -i book.mp4 cover.pngYou’ll still need to execute the first ffmpeg command above to get your M4A audio file.  Now we’ll loop that, adding the cover image and create a resulting M4V file.  Note that this does take a while to process.ffmpeg -y -r 1 -loop 1 -i cover.png -i book.m4a -c:a copy -shortest book.m4vHopefully this process is helpful for others like me wanting to use open source software but also consuming audible audiobooks.  Feel free to drop me a line and discuss your experiences or other apps &amp; techniques you use."

      "content"  : "In this post I’ll cover many of the mobile related software and tools I use on a day to day basis.  While not all specifically privacy oriented, all are mobile.  I’ll give some light background on why I use them, how I use them privately if required, and in some cases discuss how I arrived on my selection with alternatives I tried before.Generally speaking I try to take the approach of having the least amount of apps installed on my phone as I can.  I try to use browser based solutions as much as possible to limit the attack surface and information leaking to just a browser application and the website it is loading instead of another additional app.Contents                                          CalyxOS                Bitwarden                andOTP                SimpleLogin                CalyxOS Firewall App                Waze                OsmAnd                Google Camera                Google Photos                Firefox                Firefox Focus                                                        Brave                Jitsi Meet                Signal                Session                Wire                Linphone                Element                Briar                Cake Wallet                Telegram                Google Calculator                                                        Slack                AntennaPod                Plenary                NewPipe                Voice                ProtonMail                Privacy                Todoist                Obsidian                          CalyxOS I’ve previously used iOS devices extensively, and even in a minimal install and locked down state, even with some of the privacy features available in iOS 15, I can’t get around the feeling that I’m still beholden to Apple and whatever they may be doing in the closed source ecosystem.  I’ve also found that convenience in iOS is like a drug which is easy to get addicted to.  We know that privacy and convenience sit on opposite sides of the scale and I always found that I was giving up more and more privacy for convenience.When exiting the Apple garden I first moved to GrapheneOS which felt very secure, however the lack of any push notifications was a bit of a deal breaker for my work responsibilities and personal relationships.  There are certain situations were I need to get a notification.  To this end I actually started building some stop gaps using the Gofity server and android app.  Soon however the more I reinvented that wheel the more attractive CalyxOS became.  I haven’t looked back after making the switch.  For me it is the right blend of security and privacy while also maintaining usability.Bitwarden I’ve been a user of password managers for quite some time having been a loyal 1Password user from the early days of the software.  I believe that the 1Password user experience is still an edge above the rest as well as the interface design.  When I moved to running desktop Linux full time I found that the 1Password client felt sub par, definitely not as polished as on OSX.  In addition I wanted to use open source software wherever possible and Bitwarden seemed like great alternative, which it was.andOTP I’ve tried Authy, Google Authenticator, Ageis and a few other Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) applications.  I originally liked Authy for the ability to sync across multiple devices and also to recover if you lost the device.  Those features also happen to be some insecure points.  The main thing that I dislike about Authy is their attempt to lock people into using their service and attempt to monopolize the TOTP standard.  Authy also doesn’t let you take your data with you, however when I migrated away I found this great script / tutorial to allow you to get your seeds from each account you have into another app.I settled on andOTP for its backup capabilities along with the additional security configurations possible in the app.  Requiring an extra password to access the TOTP app once on the device is a nice extra layer of security and piece of mind.SimpleLogin I’ve used a few other email masking services and found SimpleLogin to be very simple and user friendly.  Additionally all the apps and backend are open source.  The ability to respond from an alias email is pretty nice though rarely used.  On the paid version you can bring your own domain which is a great way to maintain control of the emails and domain for the future.  A really awesome feature on the paid side is that the system auto-creates a new alias on your custom domain the first time you send to an alias that doesn’t already exist.  This makes it super simple for you to provide an alias on the fly at the point of purchase and have the routing “just work”.Calyx Firewall App When installing CalixOS there is an app that comes pre-installed called “Firewall”.  This lets you completely deny an app network access, or set conditions like only allowing the app to connect over VPN, WiFi etc., and it can do this for system utilities and applications too.There are several situations where I think a particular app has superior performance or capabilities but I don’t trust the author (Google Photos, Camera, Keyboard etc).  With the Firewall app, I can install these apps I don’t trust and lock them down to never get network access and have some piece of mind.Waze Waze is nice in that you can download the app and use with no account required at all.  I don’t let it run in the background, and only allow location access when the app is running.  I also keep location services completely disabled unless I’m using a navigation app as well.  I’d definitely prefer to use an open source option, but the traffic, routing and crowd sourced info (speed traps, objects on road etc) in Waze seem to be unmatched from what I’ve seen.OsmAnd~ I like to have an offline solution for mapping and OsmAnd is a great solution.  I like that you can download maps specific to the geographical areas you’ll be, and more specific maps can be layered together for specific data experiences like topo and hillshades.  OsmAnd can do turn by turn navigation, but I only use it in areas with no network connection to load other maps.Google Camera Having used the “Camera” app that comes with Graphene and Calyx, along with OpenCamera, I just found that the capabilities and resulting photos from the Google Camera app are superior.  Once I found that I could lock down the app to get zero network access ever (using Calyx Firewall) I now use it of all my photos.Google Photos Google Photos is in the same boat as the Google Camera app.  The user experience of interacting with and editing photos is better than other options I’ve found to date, and the ability to lock down the app to not call home or leak data makes me comfortable using it.BrowsersFirefox I use Firefox as my main browser for non-work content that I want to keep open in a tab or two for some, usually sort, period of time.  Perhaps I’m researching some hardware, comparing reviews etc.Firefox Focus I use Firefox focus for quick ephemeral searches.  Things where I need to look up the answer to a question, the location of a store etc, and then wipe the browser cache and history.  Firefox Focus is perfect for this.Brave I use Brave as my “work” browser to log into any work related websites and services as my employer is BYOD and I don’t want to keep multiple devices.  I selected Brave since many of the applications we use rely on Google, sometimes requiring Chrome.  Brave gives me the privacy features I want and being based on Chrome often works when an application claims Chrome compatibility.Jitsi Meet Many of my friends and family are in the iOS ecosystem and it is pretty common for people to want to “facetime” to do a video chat.  Once I broke free to the de-googled world I was now the black sheep who was now being difficult.  Since Jitsi Meet is compatible with most all mobile web browsers it takes just a couple seconds to message someone a link for a video chat without requiring them to download any software first.  I also enjoy the additional security settings I can put in place to lock down the chat, all with no account or KYC requirements.Signal I like Signal for it’s ease of use and setup for new users.  It is super easy to ask someone to use Signal and for them to get up and running quickly.  While it is perhaps the key feature that drives smooth setup for new users, I dislike that Signal requires a phone number that can expose your true identity.  I also don’t like that it can’t be used on multiple mobile devices and that you can only be signed into one Signal account at a time.  Today I use Signal for friends and family that are new to privacy and looking for secure messaging with VERY low time investment, or for continuing communications with contacts already on the service.Session I’m very excited about Session, though at the time of this writing, I just use it in a testing / experimental capacity.  I like the fully anonymous identity creation which is a string of auto-generated characters provided by the app.  There is no email or account name requirement which could be matched to your real identity or other accounts, no metadata.  Even a recovery phrase is generated for you instead of setting a password to protect you from a weak password, or reusing an existing one.  I like that the Session server infrastructure is decentralized with no central point for governments to attempt to control.  The UI/UX of the application is also very pleasant and the app can be downloaded independently from an APK rather than an app store if desired (to eliminate sources of potential app corruption if your threat model requires it).I’ll likely start moving some of my conversations and contacts that require text only over to Session and once it adds voice (currently in beta) and video it could be a viable replacement for my daily driver on secure communications.Wire As of this writing Wire is my daily driver for secure communications.  I’ve listed out the pros and cons below which can provide some insight into my preference, however in the long term as other solutions (like Session) evolve I’ll likely transition away from Wire.  Pros          End to end encrypted communications.      Supports text chat, voice, and video.      Easy setup and use that low-tech users can follow.      Nice to have features like Gifs, markup / drawings, voice &amp; video snippets, ping function and location sending      Low use of metadata that can link to real identity.  Email can be used for sign-up and can be aliased.      One account can be used on many devices at once.      Multiple accounts can be signed in on the same app.      Mobile and desktop apps for every major OS.      Open source and audited code.        Cons          Centralized server infrastructure.      Phone or email required for sign-up.      Trust in the company behind Wire is required.      Linphone For my insecure / legacy voice communications aka having a phone number, I use VOIP.  This allows me to have multiple numbers for different purposes (work, vendors / services, friends &amp; family etc.) all routed to the same endpoint.  I also want the ability to have those numbers ring on multiple devices such as different mobile phones and desktop computers.  Linphone allows meets all these needs and is open source.I have also tried Sipnetic and maintain it as a backup mobile client, however it isn’t available on desktop and I’ve found better call quality and handling on Linphone for long (sometimes multiple hours) phone calls.  Prior to my current configuration I was using MySudo which handles a lot of the technical VOIP setup required and also handles SMS, however payments are bound so Google or Apple app stores, voice call quality was routinely bad and all calls would self terminate at the 2 hour mark.Element / Matrix I use Element as my Matrix client of choice and try to use Matrix for social communities and discussions.  I like that the software is open source and enjoy the decentralized nature of the server infrastructure.  The “bridges” feature is also nice to connect matrix with other chat tools like Slack, Discord, IRC etc.Briar I currently use Briar in a testing and experimentation capacity but I am very interested in the underlying communications architecture.  I think it sets a standard that other secure communications applications should observe and implement.First Briar is open source and there are no servers, it uses each device involved in the communications as the storage of conversations which are end to end encrypted.  It is possible to deliver messages over the internet, but in an emergency, or to avoid interception and censorship, messages can be delivered via WiFi and Bluetooth.  When sending over the internet, Briar uses Tor to prevent eavesdroppers from learning which users are talking to each other.  Outside of direct messaging it also supports group communication through forums and blog posts, again following the model of storing the information on each device.  Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate.  Briar: How it worksAs seen in their documentation Briar is intended for people who need to communicate in an environment where other forces are actively attempting to stop or censor that communication as well as to identify the parties involved.  Often the parties communicating can’t or shouldn’t know each other’s true identities and their conversation medium shouldn’t leak any identifiable information.I’m looking forward to continuing to evaluate Briar and fully test out it’s features and find applications where I can use it.Cake Wallet For Crypto I mostly deal in Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR).  In terms of holding value, and possible investment I use BTC as the place where I store crypto.  When it comes time to spend those coins ideally I’ll transfer what I need to XMR and then spend.I really like Monero’s built in privacy as opposed to Bitcoin’s public operations.   Cake Wallet makes it super easy to create new BTC and XMR wallets and to transfer between them to follow my “hold / spend” strategy above.  Since Cake Wallet isn’t an exchange there is no KYC or other identifiable information making your crypto like cash as it should be.Telegram I use telegram mostly as a social media tool to follow and communicate with others over topics that are sometimes censored on Big Tech outlets.  I don’t like that Telegram is not encrypted by default, it is bound to a phone number, relies on a central server etc.  For all these reasons I don’t use it as secure messaging at all and treat it as something that could go away at any time and not mave much impact.Google Calculator The Calyx / Graphene included calculator isn’t great and many open source options are similar.  Google’s calculator app is a much better user experience and with the ability to lock it down using the Calyx FirewallSlack Slack is installed only because I need real time messaging abilities for my day job, I don’t use it for any other personal or social communities etc and would look for other more privacy oriented options for group messaging if I had a need.  That said on CalyxOS the application works well, notifications come in as expected and so on.AntennaPod AntennaPod is a great open source podcasting app.  It allows you to search most major podcast syndication outlets and has standard features you’d expect like speed control, skip ahead and back, listening queue etc.  The app experience is on par with any other podcasting app I’ve used before but has the piece of mind of not requiring an account or sending off your listening interests to a 3rd party.Plenary Plenary is my mobile RSS reader of choice.  It is full featured allowing subscription to RSS feeds, categorization of those and easy reading, saving for later etc.NewPipe I try not to patronize Big Tech especially ones that engage in open censorship like Youtube, but the reality is that there is a lot of content only available there.  To opt out of the tracking I use NewPipe.  It has a great interface, supports watch lists to save things for later and can also get around “sign in for age verification” with a simple setting.Voice I do use Audible.com for audio books so I’m knowingly giving my purchase history to Amazon.  To thwart this the best I can I use an anonymous Amazon account and download the audio books for listening offline via the Voice app.  In order to play Audible content in Voice the DRM has to be removed first using FFMPEG.  I’ve written up a separate post on that process.The Voice app is open source and has great features you’d expect from any first class audio book listening application.ProtonMail For email I use ProtonMail and I use their native mobile app.  I could definitely just use the web application since I don’t want email notifications, however the native app experience is much better and since their app is open source I don’t worry about having it installed.  Especially since Protonmail’s platform has built in support for PGP using other mail clients on mobile just feel more cumbersome.Privacy.com While I don’t use a native app for managing Privacy.com, I do use the service quite frequently and have a saved shortcut to their web app (which is a PWA for great mobile experience) saved to my mobile desktop.  Anytime I provide online payment information I always try to use a locked down Privacy.com card and anonymous account identity information.  One of the great benefits of Privacy cards in addition to the one time use, or charge restrictions, is the ability to use any billing name and address.  This allows for providing disinformation to whatever service is charging the card, enhancing your own privacy.Todoist Todoist is an app that I DO use daily, both on mobile, desktop (Linux) and web, the features and user experience are first class and I love it, however I AM constantly looking for a replacement because I’d much prefer to use an open source option that is more privacy focused.To this end I take a few precautions when using Todoist:  Use an alias email account when signing up  Do not ever use any location based features  Be mindful of how the todo content could be used to reveal your true identityObsidian Obsidian is my #1 choice for note taking and note storage.  I have used quite a few note taking apps, namely Bear for Apple OSs and Standard Notes.  In terms of criteria ideally I want them to be open source, they need a desktop and mobile client that sync together and robust tagging or categorization features.For quite some time I used Standard Notes and love that it is open source with good encryption support.  However attachments, tagging and the editing experience were sub par, even with the paid account for extensions I just couldn’t get it to a place that felt great.Though not open source presently, Obsidian meets all these criteria and then some.  The real power comes from the official and community plugins that can add incredible functionality to the app allowing for endless customization.  Additionally there is no account sign-up required at all to make full use of the application on any single platform.  If you need to sync between platforms there is a small monthly fee which can easily be paid anonymously via an alias email and privacy.com card.Phew, that was a long list.  Hopefully my experiences can provide some benefit for helping you make decisions about what applications you are interested in using ane exploring.  Feel free to drop me a line and discuss your experiences or other apps you use."
